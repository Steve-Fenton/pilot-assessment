# Platform maturity assessment prototype

This repo contains a basic prototype for a platform maturity assessment.

On answering the questions you get a spider diagram and a matrix to indicate where you are on a map right now.

You can copy the URL to share the form in its current state, for example [this pre-filled form](https://steve-fenton.github.io/pilot-assessment/?investment_1=1&investment_2=1&investment_3=2&investment_4=1&adoption_1=1&adoption_2=2&adoption_3=2&adoption_4=2&interfaces_1=2&interfaces_2=3&interfaces_3=3&interfaces_4=4&operations_1=3&operations_2=3&operations_3=2&operations_4=1&measurement_1=3&measurement_2=4&measurement_3=4&measurement_4=4)
